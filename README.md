# Data Food Consortium: Projects, Notes, and Discussions
This is a place to keep meeting notes and other artifacts that pertain one of
the DFC [project boards], [organization-level discussions], multiple
repositories, or just no single repository specifically.

[project boards]: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/projects
[organization-level discussions]: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions

### Meeting Notes
To manaage meeting notes:
1. Create a branch with a title that references the folder the meeting notes will be held in, use the format: `/projects/{name-of-meeting}`
2. Add a commit for each set of meeting notes (in a markdown file) into that branch.
3. Use a PR to allow meeting participants to review the notes & comment/amend before merging into the [main branch](/)
