## Note on Framapad & Persistence
[Framapad](https://framapad.org/) will be used for realtime collaboration during
meetings. We try to use the same Framapad URL each meeting, but the contents of
the pad will be overwritten at that time or deleted after roughly 7 days of
inactivity. Therefore, the pad's contents should be transferred here a day or
two after the meeting so they can be saved for long-term reference. Updates to
previous meetings can be merged here directly once the meeting has concluded.
