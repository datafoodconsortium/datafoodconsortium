## Data capture (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24)

Jaimie will look at publishing teh changes, as well as sorting the PHP version for the next 2 weeks.

## Standard website (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/51)

Garethe will migrate to FDC servers this Friday.

## WebID and profile (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/10)

Comments were made on gitbook during the meeting. Garethe and Simon will review again before next meeting. Gitbook is not keeping version history atm. Garethe will look into applying variants so we can keep record of versions. It still doesn't give the same power as github when reviewing comments and keeping change history. Garethe will also look into workarounds for this.

New issue opened for Garethe: https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/56

There is an ongoing conversation about the release date here: https://datafoodconsortium.slack.com/archives/C5TGDHHRN/p1752051413696409

## Allow to fetch taxonomies using content negotiation (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/57)

RDF is still useful for frameworks like Jena. 2 solutins were discussed:

- using `.htaccess` to rewrite rules in the w3id.org redirections.
- use a micro server to generate the files

The microserver needs to be maintained, so we would need to find a budget for this.

## Demo of the data sharing module CoopCircuits has built with Startinblox

this was postponed to next week's meeting.

## Reminders

- Modularizing our ontology and version control: this needs an update from the ontology circle. Convo is here https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/19

- Releases: Do we want a release schedule (e.g. 1 major per year, 1 minor per month) - we need to contribute to this discussion: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/35
