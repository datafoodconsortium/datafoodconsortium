## DevOps
    
Nicolas wrote on Slack:
- VB upgrade: DONE
- SV upgrade: DONE
- Migration datafoodconsortium.org (fr) -> dfc-standard.org (intl) 
    - VB/SV migration DONE
    - data migration  in progress, along with:
- VB/SV sync:  in progress, will create a PR soon
    - based on SemanticTurkey API
- dfc-b:Address:hasCountry:  waiting for complete data migration
- Taxonomies check: Ô∏è not started

Open questions:
- Should I reprioritize dfc-b:Address:hasCountry and do it on datafoodconsortium.org? ([GH issue](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/ontology/issues/130)): NOT URGENT
- Can you please give me insights on the data stored by VB/SV internal storage? ([GH issue](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/42)): MORE DETAILS ON SLACK
    
## Client-to-client spec

https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/48

Maxime has continued to work on it.

## Keycloak server stability 

https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/47

Further outage 2 weeks ago. Garethe to follow up with IndieHosters. 

## Data capture 

https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24

Jamie & Maxime to confirm best way to setup Unit testing to PHP connector

## Prototype

Meeting this morning with Baptiste & Florent to prep for webinar. 

We will implement a further Use Case for a logistics case with mulitple Producers & enable merging  of different Orders. This will require a different interface - to allow logistics users to get all users data from the datastore.

## Reminders

- Modularizing our ontology and version control: this needs an update from the ontology circle
- Releases: Do we want a release schedule (e.g. 1 major per year, 1 minor per month) - we need to contribute to this discussion: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/35
