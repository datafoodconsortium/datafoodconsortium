## New meeting notes process

Notes have migrated to a dedicated repository.

## Typescript implementation (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/pull/20)

Jamie needs this PR to be merge to continue his work. it was mentioned during the meeting that the PR is good to go and can be merged.

## Keycloak refresh token expiry issue (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/47)

Garethe is puzzled by the difference issuesIt should rely on high-reliability Kubernetes servers.

It's a stressful situation, especially because we don't get any notification when keycloak goes down.

OFN has implemented a workaround to use offline tokens /persistent token that might never expire (or years away). In parallel OFN UK will work anyway on setting up their own Keycloak provider. But FR users should be aware that this problem can occur again.

## DevOps(issues https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/35, https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/40, https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/41, https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/42, https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/5) 

Maxime met with Nico (@imbrou) and was able to get access to the international OVH account. Nico should attend next meetings to give updates.

# Data capture (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24)

No big update, but timeline is still on track (Thanksgiving)

# Release of connector-generator v1.1.0

We've done a new release ðŸŽ‰

## Reminders

- Modularizing our ontology and version control: this needs an update from the ontology circle
- Releases: Do we want a release schedule (e.g. 1 major per year, 1 minor per month) - we need to contribute to this discussion: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/35
