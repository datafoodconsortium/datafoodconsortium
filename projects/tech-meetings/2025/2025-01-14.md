## Devops

- Issue [#41](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/41): vocbench/git shows differences on facets.rdf (Rooster entities added, Countries added). We need to understand why => Nicolas created https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/issues/47
- The infra repo is now public :tada:
- Nicolas opened a PR on the Gitbook (fix links to vocbench)
- Secrets repository contains: admin accounts credentials + a public ssh keys folder for the team to add their keys, then Nicolas will then add them to the server
- The ShowVoc/VocBench instance on the international OVH account was switched to monthly billing (hourly = 26.13€ / month ex. VAT, monthly = 19.80€ / month ex. VAT)
- Regular user passwords have been sent individually to their email addresses.

## Data model releases

- We need to update the typescript connector: https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-typescript/issues/14
- Jamie liked the fac that Maikel managed to automate the release to ruby gems, maybe something to mimic on the TS repository. For inspiration as well, the ontology release process is documented here https://docs.dfc-standard.org/dfc-standard-documentation/contributing/general-decisions
- Release process needs to be reviewed: https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/data-model-uml/issues/21

## Data Capture
- Data Capture will be released as separate package from the start, which will require a minor code change, contrary to our first plan that would only require changes to configuration files, but that's okay b/c the platform Garethe was concerned about doesn't actually need to send anything to the Data Capture triplestore. https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24#issuecomment-2552237803
- One possible place to move the Data Capture packages, instead of `connector-codegen` per Maxime's request, is in their corresponding connector repos. They are not being auto-generated based on ontology changes like the rest of `connector-codegen` (they're currently in their respective `static` dirs), so `DataCapture.php` can go in the `connector-php` repo, `useDataCapture.ts` in `connector-ts`, etc. For TypeScript, npm has [workspaces] that can be used to manage a mono-repo containing multiple npm packages, and I should hope similar tools exist for Ruby Gems and PHP Composer.

[workspaces]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/workspaces

## Reminders

- Modularizing our ontology and version control: this needs an update from the ontology circle

- Releases: Do we want a release schedule (e.g. 1 major per year, 1 minor per month) - we need to contribute to this discussion: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/35
