## Logistics concepts (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/data-model-uml/issues/18)

This work is soon ready. This means we need to create a release. It's a good opportunity to review the release process and take care of https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/data-model-uml/issues/21

## Data capture (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24)

No recent updates from Jamie, we will try to contact him to see how he is doing

## Coopcircuits' NGI project

The first piece of work that was funded was a comparison of Beckn and DFC standards. You can read the document here: https://nextcloud.coopcircuits.fr/index.php/s/qXJSo34KMDgDiHF

We don't have any feedback from the canadian partners who know Beckn yet, but any feedback is still welcomed!

Since the start of the project, the main tasks has been to interview initiatives in u√©bec and understand their environment. From there the scope of a first product is being defined: it should be a map of all the initatives, with the ability to search.

TO get user consent on the map, a frontend component will be created using also the work that OpenTeam ahs documented here: [https://openteamag.gitlab.io/agricultural-data-wallet/designrecs/](https://openteamag.gitlab.io/agricultural-data-wallet/designrecs/#data-sharing-ui)

Such a tool needs either the client-to-client standard, either an addition to our tecjnical ontology hence https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/ontology/issues/183

Garethe mentioned also this project:

## Reminders

- Modularizing our ontology and version control: this needs an update from the ontology circle

- Releases: Do we want a release schedule (e.g. 1 major per year, 1 minor per month) - we need to contribute to this discussion: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/35
