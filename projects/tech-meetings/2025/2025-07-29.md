The link to the demo: https://dpm-dev.cqcm.startinblox.com/

The UX work is based on OFN's user feedback from curernt OFN dfc data sharing module, and Open Team's work: https://openteamag.gitlab.io/agricultural-data-wallet/designrecs/#data-sharing-ui

The repository is here: https://git.startinblox.com/components/solid-data-permissioning but will soon be transfered to OFN's github organization as Startin'blox gitlab can't be used for collaboration (Startinblox pays per users).

## Reminders

- Modularizing our ontology and version control: this needs an update from the ontology circle. Convo is here https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/19

- Releases: Do we want a release schedule (e.g. 1 major per year, 1 minor per month) - we need to contribute to this discussion: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/discussions/35
